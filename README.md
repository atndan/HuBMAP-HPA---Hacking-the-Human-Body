A Kaggle competition working on Biology dataset from HuBMAP. The goal of this competition is to identify the locations of each functional tissue unit (FTU) in biopsy slides from several different organs (prostate, lungs, kidney, spleen...). The underlying data includes imagery from different sources prepared with different protocols at a variety of resolutions, reflecting typical challenges for working with medical data.

Perform a full walkthrough EDA (exploratory data analysis), visualization the images, and modeling to predict the
segment of biology unit using deep learning model Restnet34, FastAi.
